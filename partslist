1. Xiao ESP32-C3
2. Xiao CANBUS expansion board (https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao-can-bus-expansion/) 
3. 6x N-channel MOSFETs (IRFZ44N)
5. BLDC motor (e.g., T200 thruster)
8. Various capacitors (ima probably use the ones we have on a massive role from the led company that gave stuff to Zimm)
9. Heatsinks for MOSFETs
10. PCB or prototyping board (kooper is making one)
11. Wire (various gauges for signal and power like 12 gauge for power ish to be overkill so it stays nice and cool)
12. 12v Power source
13. CAN bus termination resistor somewhere in your loop idk (120Î©)
14. Miscellaneous headers and connectors

Optional but recommended:
15. Active cooling for MOSFETs
17. Current sense resistor and amplifier (for overcurrent protection)
18. TVS diodes (for transient voltage protection)
